## A bit about myself

Iâ€™m a dev living and working in Barcelona, I'm working at <a href="http://www.b-reel.com" target="_blank">B-REEL</a>. I worked at <a href="http://www.doubleyou.com" target="_blank">DoubleYou</a> for several years, first as a Flash developer, then as a Frontend dev. Currently I make apps in javascript, ruby on rails, node.js, among others.<br/>I speak Spanish and sometimes Italian.
